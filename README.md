NYC Bike Analysis and results
Overview of analysis
Data Visualizations are very important for presenting your work. Visualizations help viewers understand the message trying to be presented much more than lines of code and numbers. Tableau is a helpful software that can assist the user in creating visual maps and graphs for presentation. 
In this module we used Tableau to visualize the statistics of the NYC BikeShare program. In this program people are allowded to rent a bike from many of the bike racks around the city.
