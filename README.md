NYC Bike Analysis and results
Overview of analysis

Data Visualizations are very important for presenting your work. Visualizations help viewers understand the message trying to be presented much more than lines of code and numbers. Tableau is a helpful software that can assist the user in creating visual maps and graphs for presentation. 
In this module we used Tableau to visualize the statistics of the NYC BikeShare program. In this program people are allowded to rent a bike from many of the bike racks around the city. 
First we had to sort the data in pyton to convert the tripduration column  to a to_datetime function. Deliverable two is where the bulk of the vizualization analysis happened. In this deliverable we made in depth visualizations on CitiBike data. We first tried to see which gender used the CitiBike program the most. This can help with advertising and determine which demographic is best to advertise to. 
The next visual we made was a image to show which times are the most popular for riders. This can help riders determine when the most amount of traffic will be. Several other data visuals were made that will help

Summary
Tableau is a very useful program for data visualizations. The results show which hours, location, and gender statistics of the NYC bike program. These will be very helpful in determining which bikes go where and at what time. I understand that damage to bike is most common. It would be also interesting to know which neighborhood have the highest instance of bike theft or damaging the bike. This could help alievate the amount of damaged bikes.
